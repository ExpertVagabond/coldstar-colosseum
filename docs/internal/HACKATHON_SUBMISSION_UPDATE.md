## 📝 Enhanced Project Description

**Title:**
```
Coldstar - Air-Gapped Solana Cold Wallet
```

**Short Description (if there's a tagline/subtitle field):**
```
The only air-gapped cold wallet built for the Solana agent economy. Hardware-grade security at software cost.
```

**Full Description:**
```
Coldstar is the only air-gapped security infrastructure in the Agent Hackathon, providing hardware-grade cold storage for AI agent treasuries and high-value Solana operations.

🔐 CORE FEATURES:
• Complete network isolation - Private keys never touch networked devices
• Jupiter DEX integration - Execute swaps while maintaining air-gap security
• Pyth Network price feeds - Real-time USD portfolio valuation
• DAO governance - Multi-sig cold vaults with on-chain voting
• QR-based signing - Secure transaction approval via camera/QR codes
• Professional TUI - Beautiful terminal interface built with Rich library

💎 WHY AIR-GAP MATTERS:
Agents managing serious capital (DAO treasuries, protocol funds) need a way to keep private keys completely offline while still accessing DeFi. Coldstar provides hardware wallet security at the cost of a $10 USB drive.

🛠️ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
• 2 DAO programs deployed on Solana devnet
• 2,500+ lines of production Python code
• Full integration with Jupiter, Pyth, Meteora, and Squads
• Complete documentation suite with 14 comprehensive guides
• Professional-grade error handling and user experience

🎯 UNIQUE POSITIONING:
Unlike other hackathon projects focused on DeFi tools or agent frameworks, Coldstar addresses the foundational security layer the agent economy needs. We're not another trading bot - we're building the infrastructure that makes agent treasuries safe.
